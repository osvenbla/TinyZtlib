TinyZtlib
=========

Arduino lib for ATTiny85/Adafruit Trinket

Quick adaption of the ZTlib for the Adafruit Trinket, in order to get a working
Humidity meter working for a egg hatching machine.

No effort have been made for the Seg8b4a036aSetAddress since I don't care about that

The use of the DHT22 seems to require the 5v/16Mhz version of the trinket.
